```markdown
# 🎓 Student Management System (C++)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Student Management System** built in **C++** using a **Doubly Linked List** for efficient data storage and management.  
It allows quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval of student records, making it suitable for educational institutions to manage student data seamlessly.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add a new student record
- Delete a student record
- Update student details
- Search for a student by roll number or name
- Display all student records in forward or reverse order
- Efficient data handling using a **Doubly Linked List** structure
